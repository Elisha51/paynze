## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated cyan (#42A5F5), suggesting technology but still on the warm side; the intention is to capture some of the character of a traditional marketplace.
- Background color: Light grayish cyan (#E0F7FA), for a clean and modern feel.
- Accent color: Analogous blue-violet (#5C6BC0), to highlight key actions and elements.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a balance of modern look and readability.
- Minimal, line-based icons that represent common e-commerce actions and categories. Icon color will match the accent color.
- Mobile-first, grid-based layout optimized for smaller screens with clear hierarchy and ample spacing for readability.
- Subtle animations for loading states and transitions, giving a sense of responsiveness without being distracting.
