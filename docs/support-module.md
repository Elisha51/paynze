# Support Module

## Overview

The Support module provides a direct line of communication between the merchant and the support team. It allows merchants to create, manage, and track support tickets for any issues or questions they may have.

## Core Concepts

-   **Support Ticket:** The primary data object representing a single support request. Each ticket has a subject, a category (e.g., "Billing", "Technical"), a description of the issue, and a status (`Open`, `In Progress`, `Resolved`).

## Key Functionality

### 1. Creating a Ticket

-   Merchants can fill out a simple form to create a new support ticket directly from the dashboard.
-   They can specify a subject, select a relevant category, and provide a detailed description of their issue.

### 2. Tracking Tickets

-   The page displays a history of all support tickets submitted by the merchant.
-   Merchants can view the status of each ticket to see if it's open, being worked on, or has been resolved.
